This is my personal portfolio created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The portfolio features my recent personal projects with links to the hosted sites and github repos. A contact form at the bottom will open the client's mail app with a pre-composed email.

I wanted to add an artistic element to the portfolio, so I researched a bit into HTML canvas, which is used to create graphics with JavaScript. The design I chose was a background particle array that populates on the greeting page of the portfolio. The particles move when the cursor is passed over them and will connect to each other within a given radius.
